# Arduino Projects - Household

This Arduino repository contains source code for Arduino projects for use around the house.


Most of these projects have supporting instructions (including circuit diagrams and other supporting files)
on my [Instructables site](https://www.instructables.com/member/gm310509/instructables/).

* Stairlight - uses motion detection to light up stairs. The program is designed to use a high voltage/high current LED strip. When turning on or off, the LED will "fade on" and "fade off".
* TemperatureAndHumidityMonitor - uses DHT22 (or DHT11) sensors to monitor temperature and humidity at various locations around the house. Data can be consolidated as required into a holistic view of your home's "comfort vitals".
* QuarantineClock - a clock that counts down the days until end of your (Coronavirus?) Quarantine. It also shows the time!
