## TA0135 4WD Car

This set of folders contains enhancements to the set of programs that come with a 4WD kit car.

The [TA0135](https://www.auselectronicsdirect.com.au/4-wheel-drive-with-ultrasonic-line-tracer-bluetoot) part number is the part
number used by Aus Electronics direct, but I've seen the same kit from many other suppliers.

The kit includes:

* 4 x DC motor and tires
* Motor driver module based upon L298N
* An Arduino Uno or clone (Iduino) and expansion shield
* Servo
* Ultrasonic sensor
* Bluetooth
* IR Receiver and remote
* LCD
* Wires
* Screws, nuts, bults and spacers
* 2 x chassis

An [annotated version of the instruction manual](https://bit.ly/3g3GSO2) can be obtained from my google drive https://bit.ly/3g3GSO2
